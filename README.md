Implemented a college application using React and Material UI to streamline student and faculty management. The application features a city dropdown in the navbar for filtering data. It comprises two modules - the Student module and the Faculty module.

Student Module:

Utilized virtual scrolling to efficiently display a large number of students of the selected city, improving performance.
Implemented a search bar for easy and quick access to specific student details.
Enabled form validations in the student add and edit forms to ensure accurate data entry.


Faculty Module:

Created a paginated table to display faculty members of the selected city, allowing for easy navigation.
Implemented a button to group faculty data by department, providing a hierarchical view of faculty information using a tree table.
